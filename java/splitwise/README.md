# Splitwise

### Problem statement
Make a splitwise kind of app with these features
1. Ability to create users
2. Ability to create groups
3. Add expense for a group of users.
4. Show current balance on each user basis the spends done.
5. Option to settle money among users basis the spends done.

### Running test cases

1. Install ruby 3.0 or above (using rvm/rbenv/similar tools)
2. Install gems (`bundle install`)
3. Run test cases `rspec`

Didn't aim to cover 100% code in specs, but 94% coverage exists by testing main service logic.


### Running locally
1. Install ruby and gems
2. Open ruby console `bundle exec irb`
3. `require 'splitwise'`
4. Run whatever logic you want to test
